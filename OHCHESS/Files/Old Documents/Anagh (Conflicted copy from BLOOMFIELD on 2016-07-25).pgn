[Result "1-0"]


[Just a little bit of context here. I was going into this round with 4.0/4.0 and the next highest person had 3.0 points. This meant that a draw secured a clear 1st place for me, and as this was my toughest game (rating wise) I would've readily accepted a draw early on. This explains some of the decreased risk in some of my moves.]

1. e4 c5 2. c3 d5 {Normal c3 Sicilian. There are lots of lines here.} 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. Be2 e6 {I'm pretty comfortable with my position here. Of course, we are still in book.} 7. O-O Nc6 8. Na3 a6 {I didn't want to get into the 0-0-0 and cxd4 lines, as I just get a little bit uncomfortable with the knight coming to b5. However, in those lines Black is totally fine anyway.} (8... cxd4 9. Nb5 O-O-O 10. Nfxd4 Bxe2 11. Qxe2 Nxd4 12. Nxd4 Bc5 {Both sides are doing okay, Black's king looks open but in reality it's not very easy for white to exploit this.}) (8... O-O-O 9. Be3 cxd4 10. cxd4 Kb8 11. Qa4 Bxa3 12. Qxa3 Rc8 {Still looks just a little bit iffy for black here. He's most likely okay but I don't like to get into these types of positons where I have to work to defend.}) 9. h3 Bh5 10. Nc2 Rd8 (10... O-O-O 11. Bf4 cxd4 12. Ncxd4 Bd6 13. Bxd6 Qxd6 {Fairly solid position for black but I chose the safer route.}) 11. Be3 cxd4 12. Nfxd4 Bxe2 13. Qxe2 Nxd4 14. Nxd4 Be7 {Just finishing development and wanting to castle early. White will get an edge very quickly if black doesn't complete his development fast.} 15. Rfd1 O-O {After some calculation and about 5 rounds of checking over and over again, I confirmed that white has no real discoveries that do any damage to black.} 16. Nb3 ?! {Wouldn't play this if I were white. The threat is stronger than the execution.} Qc6 17. Bf4 Rxd1+ 18. Rxd1 ? {A turning point the game. White reflexively made this move immediately, not seeing Black's next move.} Qa4 {Simple fork. It's not as easy as it looks, because White still has a lot of play after Black wins the a2 pawn.} 19. Bd6 Bxd6 20. Rxd6 Qxa2 21. Nc5 (21. Rb6 Nd5 22. Rxb7 Nxc3) 21... Nd5 22. Nxb7 (22. c4 Nc3 23. Qc2 Qa1+ 24. Kh2 Qa5 25. Nxb7 Qe5+ 26. g3 Ne4 {White actually looks better here, with a strong passed pawn on c4 that's about to make its trip down to c8.}) 22... Nxc3 23. Qc2 Na4 {Spent a while to make sure Rxa6 doesn't do anything.} 24. Rd2 {White absolutely didn't want a draw here, while I was going to be happy to accept one any time. That's why white isn't trading down.} (24. Rxa6 Qxb2 25. Qxb2 (25. Qxa4 Qxb7 =/) (25. Rxa4 Qxc2) 25... Nxb2) (24. Rd8 Rxd8 25. Nxd8 Qxb2 (25... Nxb2 26. Qc8 h5 27. Nxe6+ Kh7 28. Nf8+ Kg8 29. Ng6+ Kh7 30. Ne7 +- {White actually wins here. Black has to watch out for variations like this.}) 26. Qc8 (26. Qxa4 Qc1+ 27. Kh2 Qc7+ 28. g3 Qxd8 29. Qxa6) 26... Nb6 27. Qb8 (27. Qc7 Nd7 28.

Qc5 Qc4 {Trying to force trades while getting pieces to active positions. I was pretty proud of this move.} 27. Qd6 (27. Qxb6 Qf4+ 28. g3 Qxd2 =+) (27. Qxc4 Nxc4 28. Rc2 Ne5 29. Kg3 Rb8 30.

As I touched the white knight I realized Nxd2 was completely winning.} (29... Nxd2 30. Nxb5 Nf1+ 31. Kg1 Nxg3 -+) 30. Qxd6 Qb8 31. b4 Rd8 32. Qxb8 Rxb8 33. Rd6 Rxb4 34. Rxa6 {Here my opponent offered me a draw. Usually in this situation I'd have taken the draw to secure the tournament win, but because I had missed 29...Nxd2, I felt cheated. I decided to just keep pushing for the win.} g5 35. Ra7 Rb6 36. Kg3 Kg7 37. h4 Rb4 38. hxg5 hxg5 39. Ra5 Kg6 40. Re5 Rb6 41. Re1 f5 {I'm just messing around at this point, trying to get a passed pawn and seeing what I can do from there. Theoretically, this is a problematic draw for white.} 42. Re2 Kf6 43. Kh2 e5 44. Ra2 e4 {If I can get a passed e pawn Black will win.} 45. g3 Re6 46. Kg2 f4 47. gxf4 gxf4 48. Ra3 Kf5 49. Kf1 Rb6 50. Ke2 Rb2+ 51. Ke1 Kg4 52. Rc3 Rb1+ 53. Ke2 e3 {I was really proud of this move. I thought it was the only way at that time but looking back there were quite a few ways.} 54. Rc2 (54. fxe3 f3+ 55. Kd2 (55. Kf2 Rb2+ 56. Kf1 (56. Ke1 Kg3 57. Rc8 f2+ 58. Kf1 Rb1+ 59. Ke2 f1=Q+) (56.

[So in summary: I finished off the tournament with probably my best game. I was aiming for a draw from the beginning, but as the momentum shifted, I let my mentality shift to a winning one. Thanks for following my analysis!]
